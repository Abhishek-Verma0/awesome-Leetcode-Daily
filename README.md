## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

Please follow these guidelines to contribute:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository. This allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

2. **Create a New Branch**: It's best practice to create a new branch for each significant change or feature. This makes it easier to manage multiple contributions at once and keep your changes organized.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature-name
    ```

3. **Make Your Changes**: Make the necessary changes to the project. Ensure your code is clean, and follows the project's coding standards and style. Write clear, concise commit messages.

4. **Run Tests**: If your changes include code modifications, please ensure you run the existing tests and add new tests if applicable to ensure your changes do not break any functionality.

5. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes using a meaningful commit message.
    ```bash
    git commit -m 'Add some feature'
    ```

6. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your forked repository.
    ```bash
    git push origin feature-name
    ```

7. **Submit a Pull Request**: Open a pull request in the original repository. Provide a clear description of your changes and the reason why they should be merged. Be responsive to any comments or requests for changes from the repository maintainers.

8. **Follow Up**: After submitting your pull request, follow up as needed. Engage with feedback from repository maintainers and other contributors to refine your submission.
